#summary How to install Juniper

= !WebKit =

You'll need to install the !WebKit/GTK library first. This is pretty straightforward.

Download the latest six-hourly snapshot of the !WebKit SVN repository (this is much faster than checking it out via SVN as the repository is huge) and extract it:

{{{
wget http://live.nightly.webkit.org/files/WebKit-SVN-source.tar.bz2
tar xjf WebKit-SVN-source.tar.bz2
}}}

Enter the created directory and build the !WebKit source (this will take a little while depending on your system specs):

{{{
cd WebKit
WebKit/WebKitTools/Scripts/build-webkit --gtk
}}}

As root, copy the created libraries and headers to their destination locations:

{{{
cp WebKitBuild/Release/lib/* /usr/lib/
mkdir -p /usr/include/WebKitGtk
cp WebKit/gtk/Api/*.h /usr/include/WebKitGtk/
}}}

If you later want to update the repository before building again, run:

{{{
WebKit/WebKitTools/Scripts/update-webkit
}}}

Once you have !WebKit libraries and headers installed, building Juniper is simple. Just run our build script from within the checked out source directory:

{{{
./build.sh
}}}
